The Anzac Day Commemoration Committee is a non-profit organization in Australia. “ANZAC” was the name given to a combined force of First Australian Imperial Force and New Zealand Army troops who landed on Turkey’s Gallipoli Peninsula at around dawn on Sunday, the 25th day of April, 1915, barely nine months after the outbreak of World War I. On every 25th day of April for the past 100 years, “ANZAC Day” has been observed in Australia and New Zealand, becoming an honoured and sacred institution along the way. The site includes a host of information about the origins of ANZAC Day, the Spirit of ANZAC and gives an overview of the conflicts in which Australian Defence Force personnel have served in times of war and peace.

The website and shopping cart are build on [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) headless CMS and [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) as Javascript framework. It delivers a website that behaves like a web application. No complicated deploys with databases and servers, just a bunch of files that can be deployed easily on dozens of services. The site loads superfast, scales to the Internet and is unhackable.
