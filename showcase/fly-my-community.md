The Flymycomminity Community aerial Videography Web application offers real estate agents the opportunity to create and promote branded landing pages including the proprietary community videos and pictures from the Flymycommunity database. These landing pages can be promoted and shared with prospective customers that are interested in exploring the communities and surroundings of the real estate property under consideration. 

Build on NodeJS, this Application is using the API economy to its full extend. The landing pages are created, built and published through the GIT API and Netlify API. Videos are coming through the VIMEO API and pictures are uploaded through the Cloudinary API. Everything is neatly published on a superfast CDN, completely secure and essentially serverless.
